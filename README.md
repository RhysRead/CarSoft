# CarSoft

CarSoft is a project in which I am developing a piece of software to run on a Raspberry Pi connected to a
touch screen interface screwed into the center console in my car.

The aim of this software is to emulate that of more commonly known digital car interfaces such as Apple's 
carplay software, except the nature of this project means that my own version of it is more technical and
interfaces the Raspberry Pi to the car through the car's OEM port to allow readout of live data through this
software.

This software is a work in progress and many parts of it are yet to be implemented or shared publicly.
